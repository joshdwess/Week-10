        <p class="fs-1"> Back in 1955 my grandfather moved to Italy with just the vans on his feet and the love for Italian cuisine in his heart. He had never worked in a kitchen before but it was his determination that helped him create a name for himself and his very own restuarunt.

   <p class="fs-2 content text-center"> Giosuè has remained a household name in Italy since 1960, however we feel it's time to expand.  We'd like to expand to other parts of the world so that more people have an oppurtunity to enjoy our food! Where do you think we should call home next?</p>
